							<a class="image"><img src="images/Sebastian_F.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Hi my name is <strong>Sebastian</strong>, I am the Operator of FORTE Pool I am a husband and family father of 2 kids. For the last 15 years my profession was working as a mechanical engineer. I worked for 2 leading Companies in their Industry. I was ever very curious about the future, I think this is what drove me working mainly on advanced development & Research Projects. My last employment was at a company in the automotive industry where we designed steer by wire steering systems for autonomous driving vehicles.</p>
							<br />							
							<p>I got first time curious about Blockchain in December 2018. After discovering CARDANO & performing some Reserach on the Project it was very obvious for me that, this Technology and in particular Cardano is very disruptive and has the potential to improove the live of billions of people around the globe.</p>
							<br />							
							<p>In January 2020, I started FORTE Pool & decided to commit 100% of my time to support CARDANO by providing reliable infrastructure to the community. </p>

								<h2>How to delegate to <strong>Forte</strong> Pool</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>1. Register to an exchange like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/"target="_blank" ><strong>coinbase</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.kraken.com/"target="_blank" ><strong>Kraken</strong></a> & buy some ADA. </p>
							<p>2. Download and install <a href="https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/"target="_blank" ><strong>YOROI</strong></a> (=light wallet) or <a href="https://daedaluswallet.io/en/download/"target="_blank" ><strong>Daedalus</strong></a> (=full node wallet). </p>
							<p>3. Create a Wallet, and send funds from the exchange to one of your wallet address. </p>
							<p>4. Select "stake pools" in Daedalus or "Delegate" in YOROI. Search for <strong>FORTE</strong>, select & delegate.  </p>
							
							<h4> 
							After first time delegating to a pool it takes up to <strong>15-20 days</strong> until you receive your first rewards. <br />
							After this initial period rewards are payed out <strong>every 5 Days</strong> directly in your Wallet. <br />
							You can expect <strong>3-5%</strong> annualized return on your investment.
